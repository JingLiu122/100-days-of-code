# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code Challenge, and joined its recommend programming challenge website: CodeWars.com. Completed two array exercises.

**Thoughts:** Even though I have learned JavaScript before, but still having trouble with arrays. Need to practice more with arrays and get used to ES5+ Array methods.

**Link to work:** 
1. [Array Difference](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)
2. [Descending Order](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5467e4d82edf8bbf40000155)

### Day 2: December 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed two exercises on Codewar.com, and additionally refractor the "Array Difference" problem with my own solution.

**Thoughts:** Need to know more arrays and better to gear with some recursion tricks for future problem solving.
