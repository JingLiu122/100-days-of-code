# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code Challenge, and joined its recommend programming challenge website: CodeWars.com. Completed two array exercises.

**Thoughts:** Even though I have learned JavaScript before, but still having trouble with arrays. Need to practice more with arrays and get used to ES5+ Array methods.

**Link to work:** 
1. [Array Difference](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)
2. [Descending Order](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5467e4d82edf8bbf40000155)

### Day 2: December 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed two exercises on Codewar.com, and additionally refractor the "Array Difference" problem with my own solution.

**Thoughts:** Need to know more arrays and better to gear with some recursion tricks for future problem solving.

### Day 3: December 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 exercises on Codewar.com. Woohoo, got ranked up, now I can vote on beta kata (according to the notification).

**Thoughts:** Need to know more arrays and better to gear with some recursion tricks for future problem solving.

1. [Generate range of integers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55eca815d0d20962e1000106)
2. [Who likes it?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5266876b8f4bf2da9b000362)
3. [Dubstep](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551dc350bf4e526099000ae5)

### Day 4: December 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed a somewhat algorithm exercises on Codewar.com. 

**Thoughts:** The runtime of the algorithm is: O(n^2). Improve it.

**Link to work:** 
1. [Tribonacci Sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/tribonacci-sequence/train/javascript)

### Day 5: December 22, 2019 (skip two days)

**Today's Progress**: Started and relearned recursion, completed two recursion exercises on Codewar.com and a permutation question on leetcode.com (cheated a bit). 

**Thoughts:** Too difficult to come up with a recursive solution (hope one day I will get better with recursion).

**Link to work:** 
1. [Recursion #1 - Factorial](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5694cb0ec554589633000036)
2. [Recursion #2 - Fibonacci](https://www.codewars.com/kata/569512b7707bc1b88200002f)
3. [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/287592113/)
