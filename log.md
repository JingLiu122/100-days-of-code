### Day 1: December 16, 2019 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code Challenge, and joined its recommend programming challenge website: CodeWars.com. Completed two array exercises.

**Thoughts:** Even though I have learned JavaScript before, but still having trouble with arrays. Need to practice more with arrays and get used to ES5+ Array methods.
