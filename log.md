# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 Days of Code Challenge, and joined its recommend programming challenge website: CodeWars.com. Completed two array exercises.

**Thoughts:** Even though I have learned JavaScript before, but still having trouble with arrays. Need to practice more with arrays and get used to ES5+ Array methods.

### Day 2: December 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed two exercises on Codewar.com, and additionally refractor the "Array Difference" problem with my own solution.

**Thoughts:** Need to know more arrays and better to gear with some recursion tricks for future problem solving.

### Day 15: January 15, 2020 
 
**Today's Progress**: Try to solve the Tetris Scoring System problem on Codewars.com

**Thoughts:** Only passed the basic tests, not the random tests.

**Link to work:** 
1. [Tetris Series #1 — Scoring System](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5da9af1142d7910001815d32)

### Day 16: January 16, 2020 
 
**Today's Progress**: Still trying to solve the Tetris Scoring System problem on Codewars.com, can't pass the random test.

**Thoughts:** Think about this: (Note that after increasing the level, the total number of cleared lines is not reset)

### Day 17: Febraury 4, 2020 (Skip 18 days)
 
**Today's Progress**: Finally solved the Tetris Scoring System problem on Codewars.com, now the soultion can passed the random test.

**Thoughts:** "Note that after increasing the level, the total number of cleared lines is not reset" -- level variable shouldn't reset to 0, instead of declared a new variable called "LEVEL_SCORE" with an initial value 10, and used this variable to increment per 10 when a level is increasing. Resetting the level variable will miss out some lines when a level is increasing.
